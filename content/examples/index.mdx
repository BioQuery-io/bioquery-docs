## Tips for Writing Queries

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  Use specific TCGA cancer type codes for best results: LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), BRCA (breast), GBM (glioblastoma), etc.

### Be Specific

✅ "Is DDR1 higher in papillary RCC vs clear cell RCC?"
❌ "Is DDR1 higher in kidney cancer?"

### Use Gene Symbols

✅ "TP53 mutation rate in colorectal cancer"
❌ "p53 mutations in colon cancer"

### Specify Comparisons

✅ "Compare EGFR between LUAD and LUSC"
❌ "EGFR in lung cancer"
