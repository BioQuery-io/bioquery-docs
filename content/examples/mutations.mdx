# Mutation Queries

Examples of mutation frequency analyses.

## Basic Mutation Frequency

Calculate how often a gene is mutated in a specific cancer type.

### Percentage Format

```
What percentage of glioblastoma patients have IDH1 mutations?
```

**What you'll get:**
- Bar chart showing mutation rate
- Percentage with confidence interval
- Total sample count
- Breakdown by mutation type (if applicable)

### Rate Format

```
What's the TP53 mutation rate in colorectal cancer?
```

Same analysis, different phrasing.

## Specific Mutations

### Hotspot Mutations

```
How common is BRAF V600E in melanoma?
What's the frequency of EGFR L858R in lung adenocarcinoma?
Is KRAS G12D common in pancreatic cancer?
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  Hotspot queries search for specific amino acid changes in the mutation data.
</Callout>

### Mutation Classes

```
What percentage of colorectal cancer has KRAS mutations?
How common are PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer?
```

These return all mutation types affecting the gene.

## Cancer-Specific Examples

### Glioblastoma

```
What percentage of GBM has IDH1 mutations?
Is PTEN mutated in glioblastoma?
How common are EGFR amplifications in GBM?
```

<Callout>
  IDH1 mutations distinguish primary GBM from secondary GBM (arising from lower-grade glioma).
</Callout>

### Melanoma

```
What's the BRAF mutation rate in melanoma?
How common is BRAF V600E in skin melanoma?
Is NRAS mutated in BRAF-wildtype melanoma?
```

### Lung Cancer

```
What percentage of lung adenocarcinoma has EGFR mutations?
How common is KRAS G12C in LUAD?
Is ALK rearranged in lung cancer?
```

### Colorectal Cancer

```
What's the KRAS mutation rate in colorectal cancer?
How common are BRAF mutations in MSI-H colorectal tumors?
Is APC mutated in most colorectal cancers?
```

### Breast Cancer

```
What percentage of breast cancer has PIK3CA mutations?
How common are TP53 mutations in triple-negative breast cancer?
Is BRCA1 mutated in hereditary breast cancer cases?
```

---

## Comparing Mutation Rates

### Between Cancer Types

```
Is TP53 mutated more often in LUSC than LUAD?
Compare KRAS mutation rates between pancreatic and colorectal cancer
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Comparison queries for mutations are in beta. Results show rates side-by-side.
</Callout>

## Understanding Mutation Data

### Data Source

BioQuery uses TCGA MC3 somatic mutation calls:
- Curated, validated mutations
- Multiple callers with consensus filtering
- Excludes germline variants

### Mutation Types Included

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Missense | Amino acid substitution | BRAF V600E |
| Nonsense | Premature stop codon | APC R1450* |
| Frameshift | Reading frame disruption | BRCA1 185delAG |
| Splice site | Affects mRNA splicing | TP53 splice |
| In-frame indel | Preserves reading frame | EGFR exon 19 del |

### What's NOT Included

- Copy number alterations (amplifications, deletions)
- Structural variants (translocations, inversions)
- Germline variants
- Promoter mutations

## Common Questions

### "Why is the mutation rate lower than expected?"

- TCGA uses stringent filters
- Only high-confidence somatic calls included
- Some databases include germline or low-quality calls

### "Can I query copy number?"

Copy number analysis is planned for a future release. Currently, only point mutations and indels are supported.

### "What about fusion genes?"

Fusion gene queries (e.g., BCR-ABL, EML4-ALK) are coming soon.
