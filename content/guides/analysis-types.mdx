</Callout>

## Combining Analyses

For comprehensive characterization of a gene, consider running multiple query types:

1. **Expression**: Is the gene overexpressed in the cancer?
2. **Mutations**: Is the gene frequently mutated?
3. **Copy Number**: Is the gene amplified or deleted?
4. **Survival**: Does expression predict patient outcomes?
5. **Cell Lines**: Is the gene expressed in relevant cell line models?
6. **Protein**: Does protein abundance match mRNA expression?
7. **Splicing**: Are there cancer-specific isoforms?
8. **Drug Sensitivity**: Are there drugs targeting this gene? How effective?
9. **Immunotherapy**: Does the gene predict immunotherapy response?

This multi-angle approach provides stronger evidence for therapeutic relevance.
