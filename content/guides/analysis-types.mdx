## Differential Expression

Compare gene expression between two cancer types or conditions.

### When to Use

- Comparing expression between cancer subtypes
- Investigating tissue-specific expression patterns
- Validating gene signatures across cancer types

### Example Queries

```
Is DDR1 expression higher in papillary RCC vs clear cell RCC?
Compare EGFR expression between LUAD and LUSC
How does HER2 expression differ between ER+ and ER- breast cancer?
```

### Statistical Method

- **Test**: Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-parametric)
- **Metric**: Fold change (log2 difference in medians)
- **Visualization**: Boxplot with individual data points

### Interpreting Results

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  Expression values are log2(TPM+1) normalized. A fold change of 2 means the gene is expressed ~2x higher in one group.
</Callout>

## Tumor vs Normal

Compare gene expression in tumor tissue versus matched normal tissue.

### When to Use

- Identifying genes upregulated in cancer
- Finding potential therapeutic targets
- Validating known oncogenes/tumor suppressors

### Example Queries

```
Is TP53 upregulated in breast cancer compared to normal?
What's the fold change of BRCA1 in ovarian tumors vs normal?
Is MYC overexpressed in liver cancer?
```

### Data Sources

- **Tumor**: TCGA tumor samples
- **Normal**: TCGA matched normal + GTEx normal tissue

### Statistical Method

- **Test**: Wilcoxon rank-sum test
- **Metric**: Fold change and log2 difference
- **Visualization**: Grouped boxplot (Tumor vs Normal)

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all cancer types have matched normal samples. Some comparisons use GTEx data as normal reference.
</Callout>

## Mutation Frequency

Calculate how often a gene is mutated in a specific cancer type.

### When to Use

- Identifying driver mutations
- Understanding mutation landscape of a cancer
- Finding potential biomarkers

### Example Queries

```
What percentage of glioblastoma has IDH1 mutations?
How common is BRAF V600E in melanoma?
What's the TP53 mutation rate in colorectal cancer?
```

### Statistical Method

- **Metric**: Percentage of samples with mutation

### Mutation Types Included

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Missense | Amino acid change |
| Nonsense | Premature stop codon |
| Frameshift | Insertion/deletion causing frame shift |

<Callout type="info">
  Copy number alterations are analyzed separately and not included in mutation frequency calculations.
</Callout>

## Survival Analysis

Examine how gene expression relates to patient outcomes.

### When to Use

- Identifying prognostic biomarkers
- Validating therapeutic targets
- Understanding disease progression

### Example Queries

### Interpreting Kaplan-Meier Curves

- **Y-axis**: Probability of survival
- **X-axis**: Time (usually months or years)
- **Curves**: One per group (high/low expression)
- **Tick marks**: Censored patients (lost to follow-up)
- **Shading**: 95% confidence interval

<Callout type="warning">
  Survival data has limitations: follow-up time varies, some patients are censored, and treatment effects are not accounted for.
</Callout>

## Pan-Cancer Expression

Analyze gene expression across all 33 TCGA cancer types in a single query.

### When to Use

- Understanding a gene's expression landscape across cancers
- Identifying cancers where a gene is most highly expressed
- Comparing expression patterns across tissue types

### Example Queries

```

```

### Statistical Method

- **Visualization**: Boxplot with all 33 cancer types
- **Ranking**: Cancer types ordered by median expression
- **Data**: TCGA RNA-seq (log2 TPM+1)

<Callout type="info">
  Pan-cancer queries provide a quick overview but may take longer to execute due to the larger data volume.
</Callout>

## Gene Signature Analysis

Calculate gene signature scores using curated gene sets from MSigDB (33,000+ signatures).

### When to Use

- Assessing pathway activity (e.g., EMT, proliferation, immune signatures)
- Comparing signature scores between cancer types
- Correlating signatures with survival outcomes

### Example Queries

```
Calculate EMT signature score in breast cancer
Compare immune hot vs cold signatures in melanoma
Does high MYC_TARGETS_V1 score predict worse survival in lung cancer?
```

### Available Signatures

BioQuery includes the complete MSigDB collection:

<Callout type="info">
  You can search for signatures by name or function. Try "EMT", "immune", "proliferation", or specific pathway names.
</Callout>

## Gene Correlation

Analyze the correlation between two genes within a cancer type.

### When to Use

## Choosing the Right Analysis

| Question Type | Analysis | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| "Is gene X higher in cancer A vs B?" | Differential Expression | "Is EGFR higher in LUAD vs LUSC?" |
| "Is gene X upregulated in cancer?" | Tumor vs Normal | "Is MYC upregulated in breast cancer?" |
| "How often is gene X mutated?" | Mutation Frequency | "What's the TP53 mutation rate in GBM?" |
| "Does gene X predict survival?" | Survival Analysis | "Does high DDR1 predict worse survival?" |
| "Gene X across all cancers?" | Pan-Cancer Expression | "Show EGFR expression across all cancers" |
| "Pathway/signature activity?" | Gene Signature | "EMT signature in breast cancer" |
| "Are genes X and Y correlated?" | Gene Correlation | "Correlate DDR1 and MYC in BRCA" |
| "Gene X in cell lines?" | Cell Line Expression | "DDR1 in lung cancer cell lines" |
| "Gene X protein levels?" | Protein Expression | "TP53 protein in glioblastoma" |

## Cell Line Expression (CCLE)

Analyze gene expression across ~1,000 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.

### When to Use

- Studying gene expression in in vitro models
- Identifying cell lines for drug screening
- Comparing tumor vs cell line expression
- Pre-clinical target validation

### Example Queries

```
What is DDR1 expression in lung cancer cell lines?
Compare TP53 expression across all CCLE cell lines
Which cell line sites have highest EGFR expression?
```

### Data Details

- **Expression**: RMA-normalized microarray data
- **Sites**: ~30 primary sites (lung, breast, CNS, ovary, etc.)
- **Cell Lines**: ~1,000 characterized cell lines
- **Visualization**: Boxplot by primary site

<Callout type="info">
  CCLE expression uses RMA normalization (not TPM), so values are not directly comparable to TCGA RNA-seq data.
</Callout>

## Protein Expression (CPTAC)

Analyze protein abundance from mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

### When to Use

- Understanding post-transcriptional regulation
- Comparing mRNA vs protein levels
- Identifying proteins that don't correlate with mRNA
- Proteomics-based biomarker discovery

### Example Queries

```
What is TP53 protein abundance in glioblastoma?
Compare DDR1 protein levels across CPTAC cancers
Does DDR1 mRNA correlate with protein in breast cancer?
```

### Available Cancer Types

| CPTAC Code | Cancer Type |
|------------|-------------|
| CCRCC | Clear cell renal cell carcinoma |
| GBM | Glioblastoma |
| HNSCC | Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma |
| LSCC | Lung squamous cell carcinoma |
| LUAD | Lung adenocarcinoma |
| PDA | Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma |
| UCEC | Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma |
| BRCA | Breast cancer |
| COAD | Colon adenocarcinoma |
| OV | Ovarian cancer |

### Data Details

- **Metric**: Log2 ratio (sample vs reference)
- **Method**: TMT-labeled mass spectrometry
- **Normalization**: Median-centered log2 ratios

<Callout type="warning">
  Protein abundance values are log2 ratios relative to a pooled reference, not absolute concentrations.
</Callout>

## Combining Analyses

For comprehensive characterization of a gene, consider running multiple query types:

1. **Expression**: Is the gene overexpressed in the cancer?
2. **Mutations**: Is the gene frequently mutated?
3. **Survival**: Does expression predict patient outcomes?
4. **Cell Lines**: Is the gene expressed in relevant cell line models?
5. **Protein**: Does protein abundance match mRNA expression?

This multi-angle approach provides stronger evidence for therapeutic relevance.
