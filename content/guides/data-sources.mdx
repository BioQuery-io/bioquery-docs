- **Somatic mutations**: MC3 mutation calls
- **Clinical/survival**: Overall survival, progression-free survival

### Example Queries

```
Is EGFR expression higher in LUAD vs LUSC?
What's the TP53 mutation rate in breast cancer?
Does high DDR1 predict worse survival in kidney cancer?
```

## TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments)

Pediatric cancer genomics data.

### Available Cancer Types

| Code | Cancer Type | Samples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| ALL | Acute lymphoblastic leukemia | ~1,500 |
| AML | Acute myeloid leukemia | ~200 |
| NBL | Neuroblastoma | ~150 |
| OS | Osteosarcoma | ~100 |
| WT | Wilms tumor | ~120 |
| RT | Rhabdoid tumor | ~50 |
| CCSK | Clear cell sarcoma of kidney | ~20 |

### Common Synonyms

- "childhood leukemia" or "pediatric leukemia" → ALL
- "neuroblastoma" → NBL
- "Wilms tumor" or "nephroblastoma" → WT
- "osteosarcoma" or "bone cancer in children" → OS

### Example Queries

```
What is MYC expression in neuroblastoma?
Is MYCN amplified in neuroblastoma?
Compare TP53 in pediatric AML vs ALL
```

<Callout type="info">
  TARGET data uses the same RNA-seq pipeline as TCGA, so expression values are comparable.
</Callout>

---

## GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression)

Normal tissue expression reference for tumor vs normal comparisons.

### Available Tissues (54 tissues)

Common tissues used for comparison:

| Tissue | TCGA Comparison |
|--------|-----------------|
| Breast - Mammary Tissue | BRCA |
| Lung | LUAD, LUSC |
| Kidney - Cortex | KIRC, KIRP |
| Liver | LIHC |
| Colon - Transverse | COAD |
| Prostate | PRAD |
| Thyroid | THCA |
| Brain - Cortex | GBM, LGG |

### Example Queries

```
Is MYC upregulated in breast cancer compared to normal?
Compare DDR1 expression in lung cancer vs normal tissue
Is TP53 higher in tumors vs normal liver?
```

<Callout type="warning">
  GTEx samples are from healthy donors, while TCGA "matched normal" samples come from tissue adjacent to tumors. Results may differ.
</Callout>

---

## CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia)

Gene expression and mutation data for ~1,000 cancer cell lines.

### Available Primary Sites

| Site | Cell Lines |
|------|------------|
| Lung | 173 |
| Haematopoietic/lymphoid | 167 |
| Breast | 62 |
| Large intestine | 58 |
| Skin | 54 |
| Central nervous system | 46 |
| Ovary | 46 |
| Pancreas | 41 |
| Stomach | 37 |

### Data Types

- **Expression**: RMA-normalized microarray (Affymetrix)
- **Mutations**: Whole-exome sequencing

### Example Queries

```
What is DDR1 expression in lung cancer cell lines?
Which cell line sites have highest EGFR expression?
Is BRAF mutated in melanoma cell lines?
```

<Callout type="info">
  CCLE expression uses RMA normalization, not TPM. Values are not directly comparable to TCGA RNA-seq data.
</Callout>

---

## CPTAC (Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium)

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.

- **Phosphoproteomics**: Phosphosite quantification (available for most cancer types)

### Example Queries

```
What is TP53 protein abundance in glioblastoma?
Compare DDR1 protein levels across CPTAC cancers
Does DDR1 mRNA correlate with protein in breast cancer?
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Protein abundance is reported as log2 ratios relative to a pooled reference, not absolute concentrations.
</Callout>
