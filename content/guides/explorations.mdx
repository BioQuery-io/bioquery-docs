# Explorations

Run multi-query analysis sessions with context tracking and intelligent suggestions.

## What are Explorations?

Explorations are guided research sessions that:

- Track context across multiple queries
- Suggest relevant follow-up analyses
- Remember what you've discovered
- Can be converted to Projects or Studies

  Explorations require a free BioQuery account. Sign up at bioquery.io/signup.
</Callout>

## Starting an Exploration

1. Go to **Explorations** in the navigation
2. Click **New Exploration**
3. Ask your first question

BioQuery will automatically track context as you explore.

## The Exploration Interface

### Chat View

Explorations use a chat-like interface:

- **Your queries** appear on the right
- **Results** appear on the left with summaries
- **Suggestions** appear below as clickable chips

### Context Panel

At the top, you'll see tracked context:

- **Genes**: Gene symbols mentioned in your queries
- **Cancers**: Cancer types you're investigating
- **Current Focus**: What BioQuery thinks you're exploring

This context helps BioQuery understand follow-up questions.

## Context-Aware Queries

### With Context

Once context is established, you can ask abbreviated questions:

**First query:**
> "Is DDR1 overexpressed in papillary kidney cancer?"

**Follow-up (with context):**
> "What about survival impact?"

BioQuery understands you mean "Does DDR1 expression affect survival in KIRP?"

### Resetting Context

To start fresh within the same exploration:
- Say "Looking at a different gene now..." before your query
- Or start a new exploration

## Suggestions

After each result, BioQuery suggests relevant follow-ups.

### Suggestion Types

| After | Suggestions Include |
|-------|---------------------|
| Significant expression result | Survival impact, tumor vs normal, mutation check |
| Non-significant result | Check subtypes, try other cancers |
| Survival analysis | Mechanism exploration, therapy prediction |
| Mutation finding | Expression correlation, pathway analysis |

### Using Suggestions

- **Click** a suggestion to run that query
- **Dismiss** (X) suggestions you're not interested in
- **Ignore** - suggestions will update after your next query

<Callout type="info">
  Suggestions are based on your specific results. Significant findings get different follow-ups than non-significant ones.
</Callout>

## Example Exploration

Here's a typical exploration session:

1. **Start**: "Is DDR1 higher in papillary vs clear cell kidney cancer?"
   - Result: Yes, significantly higher (p < 0.001)

2. **Suggestion clicked**: "Does DDR1 expression affect survival in KIRP?"
   - Result: High DDR1 associated with worse survival (p = 0.023)

3. **Your follow-up**: "Is it also elevated vs normal kidney?"
   - Result: Yes, 3.2x higher than GTEx normal kidney

4. **Your query**: "Is DDR1 mutated in kidney cancer?"
   - Result: Low mutation rate (2.3%)

This progression builds a complete picture of DDR1 in kidney cancer.

## Managing Explorations

### Naming

Explorations are auto-named based on context, or you can rename them.

### Finding Past Explorations

Go to **Explorations** to see your history:
- Sorted by last activity
- Shows context summary (genes, cancers)
- Click to continue exploring

### Deleting

You can delete explorations you no longer need from the list view.

## Converting Explorations

### To Project

Save your exploration as a Project to:
- Organize cards into sections
- Add hypothesis and notes
- Collaborate with others

Click **Save as Project** on any exploration.

### To Study

Publish your exploration as a Study to:
- Share with the community
- Get feedback from experts
- Contribute to scientific discovery

Click **Publish Study** on any exploration.

## Best Practices

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with general questions, then drill down:
1. Is gene X altered in cancer Y?
2. Does it affect outcomes?
3. What's the mechanism?

### Use Suggestions as Guides

Suggestions represent common research patterns. Even if you don't click them, they can inspire your next question.

### Save Important Findings

When you find something interesting:
- Click "View full result" to see the complete Query Card
- Save to a Project for organization
- Add notes while the context is fresh

### Convert Long Sessions

After 5+ queries, consider converting to a Project. This helps organize your findings and makes them easier to revisit.
