**Best for:**
- Journal figures
- Editing and customization
- High-quality print

### JSON (Recommended for Developers)

Complete Query Card data in JSON format:
- Full statistical results
- Raw data points
- Query metadata
- Reproducibility information

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  JSON export includes all data needed to recreate the analysis programmatically.
</Callout>

## How to Export

1. Click the **Export** button on your Query Card
2. Select your desired format (PNG, SVG, or JSON)
3. The file will download automatically

## Export Contents

### Figure Export (PNG/SVG)

The exported figure includes:
- Main visualization (boxplot, bar chart, or Kaplan-Meier curve)
- Axis labels and title
- Statistical annotations (p-value, sample sizes)
- Legend (if applicable)

### JSON Export Structure

```json
{
  "id": "card_abc123",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "query": {
    "original": "Is DDR1 higher in KIRP vs KIRC?",
    "parsed": {
      "gene": "DDR1",
      "cancer_types": ["KIRP", "KIRC"],
      "analysis_type": "differential_expression"
    },
    "sql": "SELECT ..."
  },
  "results": {
    "answer": "DDR1 expression is significantly higher...",
    "statistics": {
      "p_value": 0.00032,
      "fold_change": 2.3,
      "effect_size": 0.85
    },
    "sample_sizes": {
      "KIRP": 290,
      "KIRC": 533
    }
  },
  "figure": {
    "type": "boxplot",
    "data": { ... }
  },
  "methods": "Gene expression data were obtained from..."
}
```

## Using Exports

### In Publications

1. Export as SVG
2. Open in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape
3. Adjust fonts, colors, or labels as needed
4. Export as PDF or EPS per journal requirements

<Callout type="warning">
  When modifying figures, ensure changes don't misrepresent the data. Always include original statistical values.
</Callout>

### In Presentations

1. Export as PNG
2. Insert directly into PowerPoint/Keynote
3. Resize as needed (PNG is high resolution)

### For Further Analysis

1. Export as JSON
2. Load in Python/R for additional analysis
3. Use raw data for custom visualizations

**Python example:**
```python
import json

with open('query_card.json') as f:
    card = json.load(f)

# Access statistics
p_value = card['results']['statistics']['p_value']
fold_change = card['results']['statistics']['fold_change']

# Access raw data for custom plotting
data = card['figure']['data']
```
