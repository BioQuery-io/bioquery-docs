# Projects

Organize your research into Projects - rich containers that capture context, hypotheses, and findings.

## What are Projects?

Projects are research containers that go beyond simple collections. They let you:

- Group related Query Cards together
- Document your research hypothesis
- Add notes and observations
- Link external resources (papers, pathways)
- Collaborate with team members

## Creating a Project

### From Scratch

1. Go to **Projects** in the navigation
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Add your hypothesis (optional but recommended)

### From Query Results

After running a query:

1. Click **Save to Project** on the Query Card
2. Choose an existing project or create a new one
3. Optionally mark as a key finding

### From an Exploration

If you've been running queries in an Exploration session:

1. Click **Save as Project** on the exploration page
2. All queries from the session are converted to project cards

## Project Components

### Cards

Query Cards saved to your project. Each card includes:

- Original query and results
- Position (drag to reorder)
- Section assignment (e.g., "Expression Analysis", "Survival")
- Key finding flag
- Personal notes

### Hypothesis

Document your research hypothesis at the project level. This appears prominently and helps frame your investigation.

**Example:**
> DDR1 overexpression in papillary RCC may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

### Notes

Add timestamped notes to document:

- Observations from your analysis
- Questions to explore
- Decisions made
- Meeting notes

Note types: `note`, `observation`, `question`, `decision`

### External Links

Link related resources:

| Link Type | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| `paper` | PubMed, DOI links to relevant literature |
| `pathway` | KEGG, Reactome pathway links |
| `resource` | GeneCards, UniProt, other databases |
| `other` | Any other relevant URL |

## Collaboration

### Sharing Projects

Projects can be shared with collaborators:

1. Go to your project
2. Click **Invite Collaborators**
3. Enter email addresses
4. Choose their role

### Roles

| Role | Can View | Can Edit | Can Delete | Can Invite |
|------|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Owner | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Editor | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Viewer | Yes | No | No | No |

<Callout type="info">
  Organization members can be added as collaborators automatically if you're on a team plan.
</Callout>

## Project Visibility

| Visibility | Who Can See |
|------------|-------------|
| Private | Only you and invited collaborators |
| Organization | All members of your organization |
| Public | Anyone (via published Study) |

To share a project publicly, [publish it as a Study](/guides/studies).

## Best Practices

### Organizing by Investigation

Create projects around research questions, not just genes:

**Good:** "DDR1 as Therapeutic Target in RCC"
**Less Good:** "DDR1 Queries"

### Using Sections

Group cards into logical sections:

- **Background** - Initial expression/mutation checks
- **Mechanism** - Pathway and correlation analyses
- **Clinical** - Survival and subtype analyses
- **Validation** - Cross-dataset confirmation

### Documenting as You Go

Add notes while your reasoning is fresh:

- Why did you run this query?
- What did you expect vs. find?
- What follow-up does this suggest?

## Converting to Study

Ready to share your findings? Projects can be published as Studies:

1. Open your project
2. Click **Publish as Study**
3. Add title, summary, and key findings
4. Choose visibility
5. Share with the community

See [Publishing Studies](/guides/studies) for details.
