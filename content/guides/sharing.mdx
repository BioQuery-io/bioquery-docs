# Sharing & Collaboration

Share your Query Cards with collaborators, include them in grant applications, and build a research portfolio.

## Permalinks

Every Query Card has a unique, permanent URL that you can share.

### Creating a Permalink

1. Click the **Share** button on your Query Card
2. Click **Copy Link**
3. Share the URL with anyone

### Permalink Format

```
https://bioquery.io/card/abc123xyz
```

### What Viewers See

Anyone with the link can:
- View the complete Query Card
- See the interactive figure
- Read the statistical results
- Copy the methods text

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  Permalinks are permanent. Once created, they won't expire or change.
</Callout>

## Sharing Scenarios

### With Collaborators

Share Query Card links directly:
- Email the permalink
- Post in Slack/Teams
- Add to shared documents

Collaborators can view without signing in.

### In Grant Applications

Include BioQuery figures and methods:

1. Export figure as PNG or SVG
2. Copy the Methods text
3. Include the permalink for reviewers to explore interactively

**Example grant text:**
> Preliminary data shows DDR1 is significantly upregulated in papillary RCC (Figure 1, p < 0.001). Interactive visualization available at: bioquery.io/card/abc123

### In Publications

For peer-reviewed papers:

1. Use SVG export for publication-quality figures
2. Include the full Methods text
3. Reference the permalink in supplementary materials

### In Presentations

For talks and posters:

1. Embed PNG in your slides
2. Include QR code linking to the Query Card
3. Audience can explore the data interactively

## Building a Research Portfolio

### Query History

Access your past queries from your profile:
1. Click your profile icon
2. Select **Query History**
3. Browse, search, and filter past queries

### Organizing Queries

Tips for managing multiple queries:
- Use consistent naming in your questions
- Export JSON for local backup
- Keep permalinks in a research log

## Privacy & Visibility

### Who Can View?

| Viewer Type | Can View Shared Cards | Can View Your History |

| You (logged in) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Other users | ✅ (with link) | ❌ |

<Callout type="warning">
  Anyone with a permalink can view that specific Query Card. Don't share links to unpublished research publicly.
</Callout>

### Data Privacy

- Query Cards contain only aggregated results, not patient-level data
- TCGA data is de-identified and publicly available
- Your queries are private until you share the permalink

## Embedding (Coming Soon)
