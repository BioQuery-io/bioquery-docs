# Publishing Studies

Share your research with the BioQuery community by publishing Studies.

## What are Studies?

Studies are published analyses that:

- Appear on the **Explore** feed
- Can be viewed by anyone
- Include comments and discussion
- Can be saved and forked by others
- May receive expert verification

## Publishing a Study

### From an Exploration

1. Open your exploration
2. Click **Publish Study**
3. Complete the publishing wizard

### From a Project

1. Open your project
2. Click **Publish as Study**
3. Complete the publishing wizard

### The Publishing Wizard

The wizard has four steps:

#### 1. Title & Summary

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title (e.g., "DDR1 as a Prognostic Marker in Papillary RCC")
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing your findings

#### 2. Key Findings

Select which findings to highlight:
- Check the findings you want to feature
- Uncheck any you want to exclude
- Add new findings not captured in summaries

#### 3. Tags

Add tags to help others discover your study:
- Gene symbols (e.g., DDR1, TP53)
- Cancer types (e.g., KIRP, lung cancer)
- Topics (e.g., survival, expression, mutation)

Suggested tags appear based on your content.

#### 4. Open Questions

Add questions for the community:
- What remains to be explored?
- What would strengthen these findings?
- What alternative hypotheses exist?

Open questions encourage engagement and follow-up research.

## Study Visibility

| Visibility | Who Can See |
|------------|-------------|
| Public | Anyone on the internet |
| Unlisted | Anyone with the link |
| Organization | Members of your org only |

<Callout type="warning">
  Once published publicly, your study and findings are visible to everyone. Consider unlisted if you want to share selectively.
</Callout>

## The Explore Feed

Published studies appear on the **Explore** page:

### Feed Sections

- **Trending**: High engagement recently
- **Recent**: Newest publications
- **Popular**: All-time most saved/discussed

### Personalization

If you're logged in, the feed personalizes based on your profile:
- Studies matching your cancer focus rank higher
- Studies about your genes of interest are boosted
- Studies from users you follow appear prominently

## Engagement Features

### Saving Studies

Click **Save** to bookmark studies for later. Access saved studies from your profile.

### Comments

Discuss studies with the community:
- Add comments (logged in) or with your name (anonymous)
- Reply to create threaded discussions
- Mark helpful comments

### Forking (Coming Soon)

Build on others' work:
- **Replicate**: Re-run the same queries to verify
- **Extend**: Add new queries to the analysis
- **Adapt**: Apply the approach to different genes/cancers

## Expert Verification

Verified researchers can endorse studies:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Methods Sound | Analysis approach is appropriate |
| Reproducible | Results can be independently verified |
| Interpretation Reasonable | Conclusions follow from data |

<Callout type="info">
  Expert verification is community feedback, not peer review. Use it as a quality signal, not a guarantee.

## Best Practices

### Write Clear Titles

**Good:** "TP53 Mutations Correlate with Poor Survival in Lung Adenocarcinoma"
**Less Good:** "TP53 Analysis"

### Provide Context

Your summary should answer:
- What question did you investigate?
- What did you find?
- Why does it matter?

### Choose Tags Thoughtfully

Include:
- Specific genes (not just "gene")
- Specific cancers (not just "cancer")
- Analysis types (survival, expression, mutation)

### Engage with Comments

Respond to questions and feedback. This builds community and improves your study.

### Ask Open Questions

Good open questions:
- "Does this pattern hold in other kidney cancer subtypes?"
- "What mechanisms might explain this correlation?"
- "Has this been validated in independent cohorts?"

## Moderation

### Community Guidelines

Studies should:
- Present genuine research findings
- Not contain promotional content
- Respect scientific norms

### Reporting Content

If you see problematic content:
- Click **Report** on the study or comment
- Select a reason
- Provide details if helpful

### Author Controls

As an author, you can:
- Edit your study title/summary
- Moderate comments on your study
- Close comments if needed
- Delete your study

## From Study to Publication

BioQuery studies can complement traditional publications:

1. Use BioQuery for preliminary analysis
2. Publish study to gather feedback
3. Refine based on community input
4. Include BioQuery figures in your paper
5. Link to your BioQuery study in supplementary materials
