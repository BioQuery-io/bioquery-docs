# Welcome to BioQuery

BioQuery lets you ask questions about cancer genomics in plain English and get **publication-ready answers** with interactive figures, statistical analysis, and reproducible methods.

## What is BioQuery?

BioQuery is a natural language interface for exploring cancer genomics data from:

- **TCGA** - The Cancer Genome Atlas (33 cancer types, 11,000+ patients)
- **GTEx** - Genotype-Tissue Expression (normal tissue reference)
- **TARGET** - Pediatric cancers (7 cancer types, 6,000+ patients)
- **CCLE** - Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (~1,000 cell lines)
- **CPTAC** - Proteomics data (10 cancer types)
- **GENIE** - Real-world clinical genomics (~40,000 patients)

All data is queried via [ISB-CGC BigQuery](https://bq-search.isb-cgc.org/) for fast, reproducible results.

Ask questions like:

- "Is DDR1 expression higher in papillary RCC vs clear cell RCC?"
- "Does high TP53 expression predict worse survival in lung cancer?"
- "What's the BRAF mutation rate in melanoma?"
- "What's DDR1 expression in lung cancer cell lines?"
- "What is TP53 protein abundance in glioblastoma?"

## Key Features

### Query Cards

Every query generates a **Query Card** - a reproducible, shareable analysis unit containing:

- Natural language question and interpretation
- Interactive Plotly figures
- Statistical results (p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals)
- SQL query (for transparency)
- Grant-ready methods text
- Export options (PNG, SVG, JSON)

### Analysis Types

| Analysis | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Differential Expression** | Compare gene expression between cancer types | "Is EGFR higher in LUAD vs LUSC?" |
| **Tumor vs Normal** | Compare tumor to normal tissue | "Is MYC upregulated in breast cancer?" |
| **Mutation Frequency** | Calculate mutation rates | "What % of GBM has IDH1 mutations?" |
| **Survival Analysis** | Kaplan-Meier curves | "Does high DDR1 predict worse survival?" |
| **Cell Line Expression** | Gene expression in CCLE cell lines | "DDR1 expression in lung cancer cell lines" |
| **Protein Expression** | Protein abundance from CPTAC | "TP53 protein levels in glioblastoma" |
