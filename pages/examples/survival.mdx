# Survival Queries

Examples of survival analysis using gene expression.

## Basic Survival Analysis

Examine whether gene expression is associated with patient outcomes.

### Prognostic Queries

```
Does high DDR1 expression predict worse survival in kidney cancer?
```

**What you'll get:**
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves (High vs Low expression)
- Log-rank test p-value
- Hazard ratio with confidence interval
- Median survival for each group

### Association Queries

```
Is BRCA1 expression associated with overall survival in ovarian cancer?
```

Tests whether expression level is related to survival outcomes.

## Phrasing Variations

All of these work:

```
Does high DDR1 predict worse survival in KIRC?
Is DDR1 expression prognostic in kidney cancer?
Do patients with high DDR1 have worse outcomes in RCC?
Is DDR1 associated with survival in renal cell carcinoma?
```

```

### Ovarian Cancer

```
Does high BRCA1 predict survival in ovarian cancer?
Is CA125 expression associated with prognosis in ovarian tumors?

## Understanding Results

### Kaplan-Meier Curves

- **Y-axis**: Survival probability (1.0 = 100% alive)
- **X-axis**: Time (typically months or years)
- **Two curves**: High expression (red) vs Low expression (blue)
- **Tick marks**: Censored patients (still alive at last follow-up)
- **Shading**: 95% confidence interval

### Hazard Ratio Interpretation

| HR | Interpretation |
|----|----------------|
| HR = 1 | No association |
| HR > 1 | High expression = higher risk of death |
| HR < 1 | High expression = lower risk of death |
| HR = 2 | 2x higher risk in high expression group |

<Callout type="warning">
  Hazard ratios should be interpreted with confidence intervals. HR = 1.5 [0.8-2.8] is not statistically significant.
</Callout>

### P-value

- **p < 0.05**: Statistically significant association
- **p ≥ 0.05**: No significant association detected

## Survival Endpoints

### Overall Survival (OS)

```
Does high MYC predict worse overall survival in lymphoma?
```

Time from diagnosis to death from any cause.

### Progression-Free Survival

```
Is EGFR associated with progression-free survival in lung cancer?
```

Time from treatment to disease progression or death.

<Callout>
  Not all TCGA cancers have progression-free survival data. If unavailable, overall survival is used.
</Callout>

## Stratification

### Median Split (Default)

By default, patients are split at median expression:
- **High**: Above median
- **Low**: Below or equal to median

### Custom Cutoffs

<Callout type="info">
  Custom expression cutoffs (e.g., top quartile vs bottom quartile) are planned for a future release.
</Callout>

## Limitations

### Sample Size

Survival analysis requires sufficient events (deaths) to be meaningful:
- Small cancers (n < 100) may have wide confidence intervals
- Rare cancers may not have enough follow-up

### Confounding Factors

TCGA data doesn't control for:
- Treatment received
- Stage at diagnosis (partially available)
- Comorbidities
- Patient demographics

### Observational Data

<Callout type="warning">
  Survival associations are correlational, not causal. High expression correlating with poor survival doesn't mean the gene causes poor outcomes.
</Callout>

## Combining with Other Analyses

For comprehensive biomarker validation:

1. **Expression**: "Is [gene] overexpressed in [cancer]?"
2. **Survival**: "Does high [gene] predict worse survival?"
3. **Mutations**: "Is [gene] frequently mutated?"

Genes that are overexpressed AND predict poor survival are stronger therapeutic target candidates.
