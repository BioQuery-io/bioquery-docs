# Analysis Types

BioQuery supports four main types of genomic analyses. Learn when to use each one.

## Differential Expression

Compare gene expression between two cancer types or conditions.

### When to Use

- Comparing expression between cancer subtypes
- Investigating tissue-specific expression patterns
- Validating gene signatures across cancer types

### Example Queries

```
Is DDR1 expression higher in papillary RCC vs clear cell RCC?
Compare EGFR expression between LUAD and LUSC
How does HER2 expression differ between ER+ and ER- breast cancer?
```

### Statistical Method

- **Test**: Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-parametric)
- **Metric**: Fold change (log2 difference in medians)
- **Visualization**: Boxplot with individual data points

### Interpreting Results

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  Expression values are log2(TPM+1) normalized. A fold change of 2 means the gene is expressed ~2x higher in one group.
</Callout>

## Tumor vs Normal

Compare gene expression in tumor tissue versus matched normal tissue.

### When to Use

- Identifying genes upregulated in cancer
- Finding potential therapeutic targets
- Validating known oncogenes/tumor suppressors

### Example Queries

```
Is TP53 upregulated in breast cancer compared to normal?
What's the fold change of BRCA1 in ovarian tumors vs normal?
Is MYC overexpressed in liver cancer?
```

### Data Sources

- **Tumor**: TCGA tumor samples
- **Normal**: TCGA matched normal + GTEx normal tissue

### Statistical Method

- **Test**: Wilcoxon rank-sum test
- **Metric**: Fold change and log2 difference
- **Visualization**: Grouped boxplot (Tumor vs Normal)

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all cancer types have matched normal samples. Some comparisons use GTEx data as normal reference.
</Callout>

## Mutation Frequency

Calculate how often a gene is mutated in a specific cancer type.

### When to Use

- Identifying driver mutations
- Understanding mutation landscape of a cancer
- Finding potential biomarkers

### Example Queries

```
What percentage of glioblastoma has IDH1 mutations?
How common is BRAF V600E in melanoma?
What's the TP53 mutation rate in colorectal cancer?
```

### Statistical Method

- **Metric**: Percentage of samples with mutation
- **Data**: TCGA somatic mutation calls (MC3)
- **Visualization**: Bar chart with confidence intervals

### Mutation Types Included

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Missense | Amino acid change |
| Nonsense | Premature stop codon |
| Frameshift | Insertion/deletion causing frame shift |
| Splice site | Affects mRNA splicing |

<Callout type="info">
  Copy number alterations are analyzed separately and not included in mutation frequency calculations.
</Callout>

## Survival Analysis

Examine how gene expression relates to patient outcomes.

### When to Use

- Identifying prognostic biomarkers
- Validating therapeutic targets
- Understanding disease progression

### Example Queries

```
Does high DDR1 expression predict worse survival in kidney cancer?
Is BRCA1 expression associated with overall survival in ovarian cancer?
Do patients with high MYC have worse prognosis in lymphoma?
```

### Statistical Method

- **Test**: Log-rank test
- **Metric**: Hazard ratio (Cox regression)
- **Stratification**: Median expression split (high vs low)
- **Visualization**: Kaplan-Meier curves

### Survival Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Overall Survival (OS) | Time to death from any cause |
| Progression-Free Survival (PFS) | Time to disease progression or death |
| Disease-Specific Survival (DSS) | Time to death from cancer |

### Interpreting Kaplan-Meier Curves

- **Y-axis**: Probability of survival
- **X-axis**: Time (usually months or years)
- **Curves**: One per group (high/low expression)
- **Tick marks**: Censored patients (lost to follow-up)
- **Shading**: 95% confidence interval

<Callout type="warning">
  Survival data has limitations: follow-up time varies, some patients are censored, and treatment effects are not accounted for.
</Callout>

## Choosing the Right Analysis

| Question Type | Analysis | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| "Is gene X higher in cancer A vs B?" | Differential Expression | "Is EGFR higher in LUAD vs LUSC?" |
| "Is gene X upregulated in cancer?" | Tumor vs Normal | "Is MYC upregulated in breast cancer?" |
| "How often is gene X mutated?" | Mutation Frequency | "What's the TP53 mutation rate in GBM?" |
| "Does gene X predict survival?" | Survival Analysis | "Does high DDR1 predict worse survival?" |

## Combining Analyses

For comprehensive characterization of a gene, consider running multiple query types:

1. **Expression**: Is the gene overexpressed in the cancer?
2. **Mutations**: Is the gene frequently mutated?
3. **Survival**: Does expression predict patient outcomes?

This multi-angle approach provides stronger evidence for therapeutic relevance.
