# Understanding Results

Learn how to interpret your Query Card and use the results in your research.

## Query Card Anatomy

Every query generates a **Query Card** with these components:

### 1. Natural Language Answer

The top section provides a plain-English interpretation of the findings:

> "DDR1 expression is significantly higher in papillary RCC (KIRP) compared to clear cell RCC (KIRC), with a 2.3-fold increase (p < 0.001)."

This summary is designed to be:
- Accessible to non-experts
- Accurate and statistically grounded
- Ready to share with collaborators

### 2. Interactive Figure

The visualization varies by analysis type:

| Analysis Type | Figure Type |
|--------------|-------------|
| Differential Expression | Boxplot with individual points |
| Tumor vs Normal | Grouped boxplot |
| Mutation Frequency | Bar chart |
| Survival Analysis | Kaplan-Meier curve |

**Interactivity features:**
- **Hover**: See exact values for data points
- **Zoom**: Click and drag to zoom into regions
- **Pan**: Shift+drag to move around
- **Reset**: Double-click to reset view

### 3. Statistical Results

Key statistics are displayed prominently:

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  All p-values are two-sided unless otherwise noted.
</Callout>

**For expression comparisons:**
- **P-value**: Statistical significance (typically Wilcoxon rank-sum test)
- **Fold Change**: Magnitude of difference between groups
- **Sample Sizes**: Number of patients in each group
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d or similar measure

**For survival analysis:**
- **Log-rank P-value**: Significance of survival difference
- **Hazard Ratio**: Risk of event in high vs low expression group
- **Median Survival**: Median time to event for each group

### 4. Methods Text

A grant-ready paragraph describing the analysis:

> "Gene expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). DDR1 mRNA expression (log2 TPM+1) was compared between papillary renal cell carcinoma (KIRP, n=290) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (KIRC, n=533) using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All analyses were performed using BioQuery (bioquery.io)."

### 5. SQL Query

For transparency and reproducibility, the exact SQL query is available:

```sql
SELECT sample_id, cancer_type, gene_expression
FROM tcga.expression
WHERE gene_symbol = 'DDR1'
  AND cancer_type IN ('KIRP', 'KIRC')
```

Click **View SQL** to see the full query.

## Interpreting P-values

<Callout type="warning">
  P-values should be interpreted in context. A small p-value with small effect size may not be biologically meaningful.
</Callout>

| P-value | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------|
| p < 0.001 | Strong evidence against null hypothesis |
| p < 0.01 | Moderate evidence |
| p < 0.05 | Weak evidence (traditional threshold) |
| p ≥ 0.05 | Insufficient evidence |

**Consider also:**
- Sample size (large N can yield small p-values for trivial effects)
- Effect size (is the difference biologically meaningful?)
- Multiple comparisons (if running many queries, adjust significance threshold)

## Interpreting Effect Sizes

### Fold Change

For expression comparisons, fold change indicates magnitude:

| Fold Change | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------|
| > 4 | Very large difference |
| 2-4 | Large difference |
| 1.5-2 | Moderate difference |
| 1-1.5 | Small difference |

### Hazard Ratio

For survival analysis:

| Hazard Ratio | Interpretation |
|--------------|---------------|
| HR > 2 | Strong association with worse survival |
| HR 1.5-2 | Moderate association |
| HR 1-1.5 | Weak association |
| HR = 1 | No association |
| HR < 1 | Association with better survival |

## Sample Size Considerations

<Callout>
  Results with small sample sizes (n < 20 per group) should be interpreted cautiously.
</Callout>

BioQuery displays sample sizes prominently. Consider:

- **TCGA data is observational** - associations may not be causal
- **Some cancer types have limited samples** - rare cancers may have n < 50
- **Subgroup analyses** reduce effective sample size

## Reproducibility

Every Query Card includes:

1. **Timestamp** - When the query was run
2. **Data Version** - Which TCGA data release
3. **SQL Query** - Exact database query
4. **Statistical Methods** - Tests and parameters used

This ensures your results can be reproduced and verified.
